 pssystem.0.t:0 "Riots in the Streets!"
 pssystem.0.d:0 "As of late our government has been loosing political influence in our country. The people, not content with the weak and unstable [Root.GetRulingParty] as our current main governmental body, have abandoned their work and go on the streets, protesting and rioting against us. If we want to resolve this troubling situation, we must act now and raise our Political Stability."
 pssystem.0.a:0 "This is only temporary."
 pssystem.1.t:0 "Big-Scale Protests!"
 pssystem.1.d:0 "Seeing how our Political Stability has been only getting worse, the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] people have now formed major protests against our government. They claim that the current political crisis in our country is proof of the shaky and unstable [Root.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] governing body. If we let this problem be, it could tear our country apart."
 pssystem.1.a:0 "This is starting to get irritating."
 pssystem.2.t:0 "Fighting in the Streets!"
 pssystem.2.d:0 "After a police officer inadvertently killed a protester that was harassing him, the situation is now finally escalating. Almost on every major street fighting is taking place between our executive forces, consisting mainly of the military and police, and the people. The people demand the current government to step down and a new one to be elected."
 pssystem.2.a:0 "Hopefully we will overcome this crisis."
 pssystem.3.t:0 "Call for Civil War!"
 pssystem.3.d:0 "Seeing no end to the fighting, the people of [Root.GetNameDef] have officially called for a civil war against us. In contrast to the irrational fighting, coordinated combat is now taking place on the very streets of our cities. This is not a matter of workforce protests anymore, it is a matter of death and life."
 pssystem.3.a:0 "May God help us."
