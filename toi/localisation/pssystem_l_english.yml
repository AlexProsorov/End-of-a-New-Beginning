 ###GENERAL EVENTS###
 pssystem.0.t:0 "Riots in the Streets!"
 pssystem.0.d:0 "As of late our government has been losing political influence in our country. The people, not content with the weak and unstable [Root.GetRulingParty] as our current main governmental body and incited by our political enemies, have abandoned their work and go on the streets, protesting and rioting against us. If we want to resolve this troubling situation, we must act now and raise our Political Stability."
 pssystem.0.a:0 "This is only temporary."
 pssystem.1.t:0 "Big-Scale Protests!"
 pssystem.1.d:0 "Observing how our Political Stability has been only getting worse, the [Root.GetAdjectiveCap] people have now formed major protests against our government, backed by the politically opposing forces. They claim that the current political crisis in our country is proof of the shaky and unstable [Root.GetRulingIdeologyNoun] governing body. If we let this problem be, it could tear our country apart."
 pssystem.1.a:0 "This is starting to get irritating."
 pssystem.2.t:0 "Fighting in the Streets!"
 pssystem.2.d:0 "After a police officer inadvertently killed a protester that was harassing him, the situation is now finally escalating. Almost on every major street fighting is taking place between our executive forces, consisting mainly of the military and police, and the people. The people demand the current government to step down and a new one to be elected."
 pssystem.2.a:0 "Hopefully we will overcome this crisis."
 pssystem.3.t:0 "Call for Civil War!"
 pssystem.3.d:0 "Seeing no end to the fighting, the people of [Root.GetNameDef] have officially called for a civil war against us. In contrast to the irrational fighting, coordinated combat is now taking place on the very streets of our cities. This is not a matter of workforce protests anymore, it is a matter of death and life."
 pssystem.3.a:0 "May God help us."
 pssystem.4.t:0 "Call for Civil War Dampens"
 pssystem.4.d:0 "Even if fights on the streets are still a regular sight, organized aggression is no more. The ones who collectively called for a civil war have been arrested or killed during clashes with our forces. We still have a long way to go, but a silver lining on the horizon can now be seen."
 pssystem.4.a:0 "Thank god."
 pssystem.5.t:0 "Fights in the Streets Stop"
 pssystem.5.d:0 "As our political climate has been slowly but steadily improving, the people seem to be calming down for the first time. Fighting gets rarer by the minute, with our forces and police ensuring the safety of our state. Hopefully all will get better with some more time."
 pssystem.5.a:0 "We will eventually recover."
 pssystem.6.t:0 "Big-Scale Protests Quiet Down"
 pssystem.6.d:0 "Because of how we managed to correct the political situation we were in, fighting has de facto stopped. Big protests are nevertheless a common thing to behold, but the worst seems to be over. One wrong step, however, and we will find ourselves in the mess we have been before."
 pssystem.6.a:0 "We are almost back on track."
 pssystem.7.t:0 "Riots gone from the Streets"
 pssystem.7.d:0 "The situation in [Root.GetNameDef] seems to have finally stabilized, with only small leftovers of protesters on the streets. As we managed to raise Political Stability of our country to its former standards, workers from all around the nation head back to the factories and farms. The situation is lastly resolved."
 pssystem.7.a:0 "We hope it is over."
 pssystem.8.t:0 "High Political Stability!"
 pssystem.8.d:0 "Recently our sphere of influence in our country had spread yet again, furthering our political grasp. Our policies rarely get denied, and thanks to our guidance, [Root.GetName] is in a politically stable stance."
 pssystem.8.a:0 "This is proof of our efficiency."
 pssystem.9.t:0 "Political Stability Falls"
 pssystem.9.d:0 "Having enjoyed great political influence in the past weeks, our government now faced a few difficulties when trying to pass new policies. Perhaps being a sign that our way of ruling has become a bit too lax, we have to accept the fact that the current political climate does not allow for errors anymore."
 pssystem.9.a:0 "This reeks of opposition."
 pssystem.10.t:0 "Opposition Rises"
 pssystem.10.d:0 "Recently we have received word that the political opposition in our country is on the rise again. Multiple associations and small organizations begin to move inside the government, hindering our rule over [Root.GetName]. Even if these oppositions are tiny at the moment, we should be on guard."
 pssystem.10.a:0 "So what? We're the only ones who can rule [Root.GetNameDef]."
 pssystem.11.t:0 "Opposition Sinks"
 pssystem.11.d:0 "It did not come to anyone as a surprise, but many governmental politicians who tried to oppose [Root.GetRulingParty] have quieted down, thanks to our efforts. However, it is to be assumed that there still are people who would like to see somebody else as the leader of [From.GetNameDef] than [Root.GetLeader]."
 pssystem.11.a:0 "They've accepted the factual truth."
 pssystem.12.t:0 "Overwhelming Political Stability"
 pssystem.12.d:0 "Not having experienced any difficulties, our government by now is known as a very stable one among our neighbours. Passing laws is nowhere close to a troublesome process anymore, but instead a fast and efficient routine. [Root.GetName] is truly in a period of political prosperity."
 pssystem.12.a:0 "We have a bright future ahead of us."
 pssystem.13.t:0 "No Opposition Left"
 pssystem.13.d:0 "The opposition to the current governing body of [Root.GetName] is now de facto non-existent. Every single politician supports us, or at least is not against us, making the political climate in our country very relaxed."
 pssystem.13.a:0 "[Root.GetNameDef] is great!"
 pssystem.14.t:0 "Underwhelming Political Stability"
 pssystem.14.d:0 "The \"Period of political prosperity\" in [Root.GetNameDef] seemingly ended today, with a resurgence of politicians and writers, critizing the current political state of [Root.GetName]. Laws are yet again a topic to fight about and the [Root.GetRulingIdeology] [Root.GetRulingParty] will have to put up with difficulties."
 pssystem.14.a:0 "We have to move forward."
 pssystem.15.t:0 "Opposition Returns"
 pssystem.15.d:0 "As if out of the blue, a few political voices of discontent rang throughout [Root.GetName]. It was simply too good to be true; the Political Stability the government of [Root.GetName] enjoyed lasted for some time, only to lose some Stability later. Still, many are not worried about this event, seeing how the Political Stability within [Root.GetNameDef] remains relatively high."
 pssystem.15.a:0 "What went wrong?"
