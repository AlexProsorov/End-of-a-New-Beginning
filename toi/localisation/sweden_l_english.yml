 SWE_lifeguard:0 "Deploy the Life Regiments!"
 SWE_lifeguard_desc:0 "Since the Liberation War of the 1500s, the Life Regiments have been the personal lifeguard of the King. Being owned, and therefore financed, by the wealthiest aristocrat in the Kingdom, they were traditionally better trained and equipped than their provincial counterparts. Though the centralisation of recent years mean that all regiments are owned and financed by the state, these regiments are still considered to be the more prestigious units in the Swedish Army, and are often personally commanded by the King in battle. Now more than ever, we need these units to enter the fray. With some... Gentle persuasion, we might be able to convince the King to resign his command, and appoint a far more competent Colonel in his stead. The Second-in-Command of the Life Regiment Hussars, Carl Herman Leuheusen, is a popular candidate"

 sweden_political.1.t:0 "The Municipal Reforms of [GetYear]"
 sweden_political.1.d:0 "Ever since the 1520s, cities and parishes in Sweden have been ruled to a near-dictatorial extent by Mayors undemocratically appointed by the Privy Council in Stockholm. This has been subject to heavy criticism with accusations of corruption, quid pro quos, and partisan bias being ever present. The heavy-handed approach of many frankly unqualified mayors has resulted in a general feeling of disenfranchisement among the peasantry. Public outcry demanding that Mayors be democratically elected and for Local Parliaments to be established have grown deafening, and many legislators have begun seriously discussing a widespread reform to address these issues. \n\nThe Current Consensus proposes that Parishes be abolished as juicidal regions entirely, and the country instead be divided into Municipalities, the size of which will be determined by population and area. Each municipality will have its own parliament of democratically elected representatives who are tasked to oversee the day-to-day business of the region. The Mayor, in this new system, will see his power signifcantly curtailed and will serve as little more than a figurehead. \n\nProponents of this reform argue that not only are these changes prinicipally justified for our society to be truly free, but also that it will decrease corruption and, with power distributed among many people rather than one, will result in a more competent administration. By abolishing parishes, we would also take steps in the direction of secularisation, where competancy is higher valued than your ability to cite scripture, the argument goes. \n\nOpponents cite tradition, arguing that it is wildly disrespectful to go against three centuries of heritage because some peasants feel repressed. With power based on local elections rather than Government Appointments, this also stands to challenge the more authoritarian minded of society."
