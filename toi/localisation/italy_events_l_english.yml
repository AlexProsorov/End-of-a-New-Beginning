 sardinia.9.t:0 "Sardinia-Piedmont"
 sardinia.9.d:0 "A number of events promoted Piedmont’s prestige in Italy and abroad. In March 1854 France and England intervened in support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia in the Crimean War. To obtain Austrian support, they were prepared to guarantee the status quo in Italy. Only Piedmont was in a position to disrupt it at that time, and Cavour negotiated an alliance with the Western powers. In May he sent to Crimea an army that performed brilliantly. As a result, Piedmont was able to assume a place among the victors at the Congress of Paris (February 1856). From this platform Cavour, achieving a diplomatic coup for Piedmont and Italy, declared that the only threat to peace in Italy, and the root cause of subversive plots, was the burdensome Austrian overlordship. Cavour’s pronouncements at the congress increased the standing of Piedmont among nationalists."

 sardinia.10.t:0 "The Plombieres Meeting"
 sardinia.10.d:0 "Austrian influence must be removed from the Italian peninsula no matter the cost. Italy cannot be truly reunified unless steps are taken to ensure freedom from the meddling Austrians. Luckily, Napoleon III of France shares with us a common enemy. We should send Count Cavour to meet with him, but none must know of this. We will disguise the trip as a mere vacation to Switzerland while Count Cavour will travel on to Plombieres, where the French Emperor has agreed to meet with us. Together, the two leaders will plan an invasion of the Austrian-controlled part of our beautiful peninsula, and drive out foreign influence. We are prepared to offer Napoleon Nice and Savoy in return for assistance. With French aid, soon, we will be reunified. "
