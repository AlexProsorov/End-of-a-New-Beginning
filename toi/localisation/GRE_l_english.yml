Greecefocus.4.t:0 "Independence Day!"
Greecefocus.4.d:0 "Euphoria and ecstasy have swept through Greece today as today marks our country’s Independence Day from the Ottoman Empire in 1821. Although some believe the revolution did not officially commence on the 25th of March, most recognise today as the end of Turkish occupation. Today was the day Bishop Germanos blessed our flag and raised it just outside the gates of Agia Lavra, a famous monastery in Achaea."
