 #EoaNB : Reformation events
 #c0_government.1.t:0 "Questioning the Status Quo"
 #c0_government.1.desc.m:0 "For centuries our nation has followed the traditions of the past, organising our people under heirarchies and valuing what was written long ago more than what we need now. \nFollowing the incoming tide of industrialisation and modernisation, perhaps it is time for us to make some changes.\n"
 #c0_government.1.desc.d:0 "We have escaped from the tyranny of monarchies for a while, but it remains true that the influences of the past still shadow the future we may take. \nIn the ever changing world, it is only right for us to embrace the new norm, through the questioning of what was common sense in the past.\n"
 #c0_government.1.a:0 "Summon the council and start a discussion."
 #c0_government.1.b:0 "Follow the example of the forerunners; we can't afford to waste time."

 #c0_government.3.t:0 "Reformation within the Government"
 #c0_government.3.desc.a:0 "After a thourough discussion on the topic of reformation, our council has layed out the optimal options for our situation. On top of this, we must first decide how quickly we will implement these reformations."
 #c0_government.3.desc.b:0 "We have examined the examples of the succesful nations and their policies. While some are worrying if these policies will work for our nation, we must first decide how quickly we will implement these reformations."
 #c0_government.3.desc.c:0 "By standing on the critical view of the current system, we have discovered several flaws that need immediate fixing. We must now decide how quickly we plan to implement these reformations."

 #c0_government.4.desc:0 "After analysing several precedents and discussing on a few ideas, the [ROOT.GetAdjective] government has finally figured out a plan to sustain our nation throughout the reformation."
 #c0_government.4.a:0 "Very well!"
 #c0_government.5.t:0 "First Policy Put in Order"
 #c0_government.5.desc:0 "An exciting moment in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] history, the first policy under the name of the reformation has been taken. We worry if it will bring success or turmoil to our nation, but at first glance we are making great strides."
 #c0_government.5.a:0 "We have already come halfway."
 #c0_government.5.b:0 "A healthy dose of criticism is always a good idea."
 #c0_government.X.t:0 "The Reformation is Succesful"
 #c0_government.X.desc:0 "Quite some time has gone since we first started our reformation policies, and during such we have put these ideas to the test. While it is impossible to eliminate all dissentients within our government about our new stance, we have proved the benefits of an opened system through industrial growth and the content of our people."
